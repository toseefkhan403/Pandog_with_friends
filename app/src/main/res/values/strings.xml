        <item>Celfie is all about giddiness and playfulness along with an awesome opportunity to become popular while having fun.</item>
        <item>The battle section is all heated up with the face-offs of the best pictures of our users. Here you can actually participate or vote for ones you like.</item>
        <item>To start a battle you have to follow the given steps- \n
1. Follow the person you want to compete with either from the search screen or from the map screen. \n
2. Go to the share screen, upload the photo and select the person you want to compete with.
    (You can select only one person at a time) \n
3. If he/she accepts your request, your post gets displayed.</item>
        <item>Your post stays for 24 hours in the feed of all of your followers and all of the followers of your friend with whom you have chosen to compete. Whoever gets the maximum
        likes, wins. Both of you will be notified about the results when the duration of your post is over.</item>
        <item>If you win, you will get the precious flames that determine your visibility on the Map section of the app.
        You will get +5 flames if you win a challenge, +1 if you receive a follower, and -2 if you lose a challenge. Flames will determine your popularity in the app,
        so make sure you win maximum of your battles and gain more followers at the same time.</item>
        <item>The different levels in the app reflect the popularity, wins a person is getting on his/her posts. As your wins per post keep on
            increasing, then your profile is automatically updated to the next level.</item>
        <item>Its a unique feature to know the most popular person of your locality or any other place. This keeps on updating depending upon the maximum wins got by a person in a particular locality.</item>
        <item>This list tells you the top contenders in the Map area that you are viewing.As you zoom out or move the map, new people who are more popular can be seen in
            the list. The person at the top is the most popular.</item>
        <item>Initially, when you join the app, you are on level 1 which is a GREY BADGE(the smallest guy). It means that on the Map screen, your location will be shown with a grey coloured marker.
        As you use the app actively and stay updated, get more wins and followers, then you will be updated to level 2 that is a GREEN BADGE.
        Subsequently, level 3 BLUE BADGE, level 4 PURPLE BADGE and then level 5.. the ultimate BLACK BADGE, which can clearly be seen on the Map as it is the biggest of them all.
            Of course, if you manage to get the BLACK BADGE, your profile will gain more attention among the audience.
</item>
        <item>Unfortunately NO. The badge colour that you own depends upon the current users of the app which keep updating every second. And that is the reason that the battle ground is going to stay heated up every time you show up.
         This option also provides equal opportunity to everyone using the app. You joined the app today and showed up more often then you may get the ultimate BLACK badge and the guy owning one and not showing up will be replaced.
</item>
        <item>The ultimate BLACK badge is owned by the top 20% users of the Celfie app.</item>
        <item>Click the "EDIT YOUR PROFILE" button, go to the bottom and log out of the app.</item>
