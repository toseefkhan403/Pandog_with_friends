    //ToDo: Write codes in Next activity so that the user can choose from his friends to compete.
    //step1: submit photo to firebase STORAGE(not database)(database will only store an url pointing to that image).
    //step2: in nextActivity, user can see the image he has chosen, and below will be the list of all the persons whom he follows/ or the ones who follow him.
    //step3: on clicking upon his friends name, this pending post can be seen in an fragment which will be available in HomeActivity(to be created).
    //step4: Now the user's friend will get a notification about this. He can choose to either accept or ignore, and after he submits his photo, a post will
    // be created which will be available on the main feed of both the users and their respective followers.
    //step5: All the important notifications must be provided to both the users(if someone accepts their request they should get a notif)
    //step6: All the posts created by a particular user can be seen under his ProfileActivity replacing the currently placed gridView.
    //ToDo: Create the post. It will be available for 24 hours.
    //ToDo: Create mainFeedListAdapter to display posts in the HomeActivity.


    //i can do the uploading to firebase STORAGE part. Tell me if you want me to do it.
    //layout for a basic post is in layout_post
